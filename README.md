## Getting Started
To get started, here is the link to [iOS SDK integration documentation](https://github.com/AdColony/AdColony-iOS-SDK-3/wiki).

**Note:**

* SDK 3.2.1 is tested and verified on iOS 11 beta 10 version
* SDK 3.2.1 compiles on iOS 6; however, video ads will only show on iOS 8 and above.
* SDK 3.2.1 is not backwards compatible with any AdColony 2.0 integrations due to major API changes.

## Upgrade

#### SDK 2.X
Please note that updating from our 2.x SDK is not a drag and drop update, but rather includes breaking API and process changes. In order to take advantage of the 3.x SDK, a complete re-integration is necessary. Please review our [documentation](https://github.com/AdColony/AdColony-iOS-SDK-3/wiki) to get a better idea on what changes will be necessary in your app.

For detailed information about the AdColony SDK, see our [iOS SDK documentation](https://github.com/AdColony/AdColony-iOS-SDK-3/wiki).

#### SDK 3.X
Updating from our previous SDK 3.x to SDK 3.2 requires no code changes. If you are not using CocoaPods, all you need to do is drag and drop the framework into your Xcode project. If you are using Cocoapods, however, all you need to do is sync with the latest by running `pod update`.
